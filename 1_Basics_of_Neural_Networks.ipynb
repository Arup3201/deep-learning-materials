        "### Introducing the `tf.keras.Sequential` API\n",
        "Someone can make neural networks in many different approaches. There are a lot of libraries out there which can efficiently build a neural network with ease and then train it on dataset. Someone can also make it from scratch to customize with their problem in hand. But, in this notebook, we will look at the easiest one among. `Tensorflow` provides `keras` interface which can build neural networks in not more than 3 lines of code.\n",
        "The API we will use here is `tf.keras.Sequential` which enables us to stack one layer after another and build the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introducing `tf.keras.layers` as the base of neural network\n",
        "The building blocks of a neural network are the `layers` present inside it. You can think of `layers` as a filter through which the data is going through and everytime the data passes one `layer`, the `layer` transforms the data into a more useful form that helps to map it to the answer. In this example, we are only using 1 unit so it might not be that much visible to understand what a layer does but in the upcoming examples it will become more clear.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Some details regarding `tf.keras.layers.Dense`\n",
        "`Dense` is the layer that we will be using for implementing the linear regression model. We can specify how many neurons we want in this layer with the `units` arguement present in `Dense` class. If there are 2 `Dense` layers connected with each other, we call it `fully-connected layer`.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### The neural network archietecture\n",
        "In this notebook file, we will look at some of the basic layers to make a neural network archietecture. In this example, we will particularly look at 3 layers -\n",
        "1. `Input` layer: This is the layer through which the input values will pass. The `Input` layer takes the `shape` of the input. In this example, the inputs are just 1 so `shape=[1]`.\n",
        "2. `Dense` layer: The `Dense` layer takes `units` arguement which is simply how many neurons does we want in this layer. In this example, we want one output so `units=1`.\n",
        "3. `Activation` layer: The `Activation` layer which applies an activation function (in this case, it is `linear`) on the output of the previous layer (in this case, it is Dense layer with 1 unit).\n",
        "\n",
        "### `units=1` in `Dense` layer\n",
        "As we are implementing simple linear regression model, we just need one neuron. This one neuron has weight and bias (`W and b`) which will be learnt by the model from the training data. This makes it a very simple neural network which has only 2 parameters to learn from the training samples. It makes the training faster also because the complexity is very less.\n",

In short, whatever I will include in the list of metrics, I will be able to monitor them as the training and testing goes.

But, as it goes through the examples and calculates the output with its intially guessed rules, it finds out that those outputs are not exactly same as the output provided in the examples, with the help of the `loss` function. So, it improves it's guess with the help of `optimizer` and again starts guessing with new model parameter values(`w` and `b`). The logic is, every time the guess should be better than the previous one, which is the job of optimizer.\n",
